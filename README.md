# Gloomhaven-Monster-Attack-Modifier-Cards

Gloomhaven is a Euro-style tactical combat board game. Players dungeon-crawl through different scenarios with other adventurers to proceed in their campaign, discover new regions, and advance their individual character's goals. I'm heavily addicted to this game and am so impressed with how fun and easy it is to play. However, one shortcoming I noticed is that there are so many pieces. Every scenario requires unique monsters, their clips, monster attack cards, overlay tiles, and attack modifier cards. To make the set up for my group a little easier, I designed this app to generate the attack modifier cards. Now my friends and I can spend less time shuffling the cards during the game and more time slaying!
